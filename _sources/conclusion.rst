Conclusion
============

To date, the project has:

#.	Identified and sorted categories of test evidence required for CMVP validation that can readily be automated in a reporting format that is consistent with current Web CRYPTIK used by CMVP, and identified those test evidence classes for which manual processes are still needed. 

#.	Identified necessary schemas and protocols for report submission and validation for a scalable API-based architecture.

#.	Designed and developed a cloud-based infrastructure required to support validation program automation. 

Moving forward, the project staff plans in FY 2025 to:

#. Finalize a coordinated JSON structure for test evidence catalogue

#. Refine the research infrastructure to support enabling automated acceptance of test evidence and processing of functional test evidence from NVLAP-accredited parties

#. Streamline test methods for functional testing

#. Improve test requirement filtering capabilities

#. Demonstrate an ability for the CMVP staff to use an API to handle “comment round” interactions with NVLAP-accredited parties.
