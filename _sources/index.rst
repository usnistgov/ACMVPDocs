Automation of the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program
============================================================================================================================

**September 2024 Status Report**

September 18, 2024

Abstract
---------

The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) validates third-party assertions that cryptographic module implementations satisfy the requirements of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 140-3, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. The NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) has undertaken the Automated Cryptographic Module Validation Project (ACMVP) to support improvement in the efficiency and timeliness of CMVP operations and processes. The goal is to demonstrate a suite of automated tools that would permit organizations to perform testing of their cryptographic products according to the requirements of FIPS 140-3, then directly report the results to NIST using appropriate protocols. This is a status report of progress made so far with the ACMVP and the planned next steps for the project.

Audience
----------

The primary audience for this report is technology, security, and privacy program managers and architects, and software developers, engineers, and IT professionals.

Collaborators
---------------

Collaborators participating in this project submitted their capabilities in response to an open call in the Federal Register for all sources of relevant security capabilities from academia and industry (vendors and integrators). The following respondents with relevant capabilities or product components signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to collaborate with NIST in a consortium to build this example solution.

- Acumen Security
- AEGISOLVE
- Apple
- atsec
- AWS
- Cisco
- Lightship Security
- Microsoft
- NXP Semiconductors
- SUSE

Certain commercial entities, equipment, products, or materials may be identified by name or company logo or other insignia in order to acknowledge their participation in this collaboration or to describe an experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply special status or relationship with NIST or recommendation or endorsement by NIST or NCCoE; neither is it intended to imply that the entities, equipment, products, or materials are necessarily the best available for the purpose.
