Abstract
---------

The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) validates third-party assertions that cryptographic module implementations satisfy the requirements of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 140-3, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. The current cryptographic module validation process is heavily manual, out of sync with the speed of technology industry development and deployment. Thus, the NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) has undertaken the Automated Cryptographic Module Validation Project (ACMVP) to support improvement in the efficiency and timeliness of CMVP operations and processes. The goal is to demonstrate a suite of automated tools that have the potential to make the FIPS 140-3 validation process more efficient and provide higher assurances that test findings reported for modules meet FIPS 140-3 requirements. 

This report is the second status report for the project, which describes progress made between September 2024 and April 2025 and planned next steps. A prior update of work accomplished can be found in the `September 2024 status report <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.37.ipd.pdf>`__. This document outlines progress across each of the three workstreams: the :ref:`Test Evidence (TE) Workstream <Test Evidence Workstream>`, the :ref:`Protocol Workstream <Protocol Workstream>`, and the :ref:`Research Infrastructure Workstream <Research Infrastructure Workstream>`, each a focused effort in its own right. The combined impact of these workstreams intends to result in improvements to the overall automation of the CMVP.

Audience
----------

The primary audience for this report is technology, security, and privacy program managers, architects, software developers, engineers, and IT professionals involved with the CMVP, and accredited cryptography and security testing labs, and conformance offices at companies that produce security software and hardware.

Keywords
---------
Automated Cryptographic Module Validation Project (ACMVP); Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP); cryptography; cryptographic module; cryptographic module testing; cryptographic module validation.
